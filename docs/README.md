# Frontend (my-ex) docs

Database design, schema scripts, and service-ownership docs have been **moved** to the **my-ex-master-data-service** repository (backend).

To copy them into that repo, use the files in the **`_copy-to-master-data-service`** folder at the project root. See that folder’s README for instructions.
